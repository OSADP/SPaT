Name of open source package:	 Signal Phase and Timing

Version number:	 1.2

Key functionalites and capabilities:	This software supports generation of several over-the-air message to include SPAT, MAP, RTCM and SSM.  SPaT is generated based on a NTCIP block object 'pushed' from a SPaT-enabled Traffic Signal Controller.  The MAP message originates on the host computer for this software and is based on an input file for which the format is described herein.  RTCM depends on the availability of an NMEA v2.1 or 3.0 data feed and has only been tested in a controlled environment at the Turner-Fairbank Highway Research Center.
